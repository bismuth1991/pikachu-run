# Pikachu RUN

A clone of Google Chrome dinosaur game but with different sprites and more interactivity
  + Obstacles
    + cacti, birds will be replaced my animated pokemon sprites
    + There will be Team Rocket flying on a Meowth balloon on the top right of the screen, shooting bouncing bubbles down
  + Interactivity
    + pikachu can run forward, jump, roll backwards
    + pikachu can use skill 'thundershock' to either: remove a bubble or flying obstabcle from the screen
    + I'll think of another skill and implement it during the project
    + Skills will have cooldown
